# Planning Tools - AfterWords

## SCOR Method

### S - Situation

For now I just have the main idea of the Moonshot and some tracks to follow on how to design the project and on what it would consist.

### C - Constraints

My main constraints is my time management and my lack of moticvation when I am at home. I am currently facing trouble motivating myself since I need a lot of rest. I'd rather sleep and chill than working on my project and ending tired the next day.

### O - Objectives

My objective is to start the project, once it would be strated I will no longer procrastinate. My first objective would be to ensure I have a market that is actually interested in my project. To be sure I'm not creating a product that no-one needs.

### R - Resources

To do so, I'll need Google to find my market and the company I need.
I'll also need to use a messagerie such as Google Mail or LinkedIn to contact them.

## Action Plan

### A - Specific Short-term Goal (1 to 2 weeks)

My short-term goal would be to assure I have a target audience willing to buy my product. And also to define my project to present it clearly and consisely to them.

### B - Concrete Actions to take strating tomorrow

- Finding some company to contact on LinkedIn or Google.
- Defining my Project Goals and Requirements.

### C - Possible Obstacles And Anticipated Solutions

The main obstacle I'll be facing would be the procrastination and the lack of answers or at least the time before getting those.

To avoid losing time, I should find companies to contact and send a mail to them ASAP.
While waiting for an answer, I should define the basics of my project and starting some documents such as the project charter and the README.

### D - How I Will Measure My Progress

My progress will be measurable with the response mail I would receive.
I will need at least 10 response to fully achieve this task. \
Concerning my documents, the progress would be measured as the number of parts written.
