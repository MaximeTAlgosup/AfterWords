In the case of separation, as long as a divorce has not been finalized, the legal spouse remains the beneficiary.

#### 2.2.2. Conditions

At the time of death, the recipient may have been in different situations, such as:

- Receiving unemployment benefits,
- Or eligible to receive them (i.e., the recipient was in a waiting period, deferral of payment, or benefits were temporarily suspended due to entering a training program or due to illness).

The death benefit is not payable if the death occurred during a non-compensated period following a rejection decision for seasonal unemployment.

#### 2.2.3. Where to Apply

Send a letter to the ASSEDIC office the deceased was affiliated with. [Template](./templates/employerAndAssedic/declarationDeDécèsAssedic.md)

### 3.1. The Death Benefit for Insured Employees (CPAM or MSA)

More on that subject can be read at this link to [service-public](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1544).

#### 3.1.1. Beneficiaries

The spouse; failing that, the children; failing that, the ascendants; and if none, any other collateral relatives, in-laws, or third parties.

There are two categories:

- **Priority beneficiaries**: if, on the day of death, they were fully, effectively, and permanently dependent on the insured person and if they submit the request within one month following the death.
- **Non-priority beneficiaries**: if none of the individuals qualify as priority beneficiaries, or if no priority is claimed within the one-month period, the death benefit may be paid to the legal (non-separated) spouse or to the partner bound to the deceased by a civil union (PACS). Failing that, it may be paid to the descendants, and if none, to the ascendants who submit the request within two years after the death.

> [!NOTE]
> When two persons have the same priority hierarchy, the death benefit would be parted equally.

#### 3.1.2. Conditions

The insured person who was actively employed or maintaining certain rights (including unemployed individuals receiving benefits) is eligible for the death benefit if they met one of the following conditions within the year prior to death or work stoppage:

| Condition                                                     | Details                                                        |

| Worked 120 hours                                              | Over a period of 3 calendar months                             |

> [!NOTE]
> If the beneficiary is a minor, the request must be submitted by their legal representative.

#### 3.1.3. Amount

The death benefit is equal to the salary earned by the deceased during the last 3 months of employment.

> [!WARNING]
> The amount of death benefit would lie between €375.48 and €9,387.00.

The death benefit is not subject to C.S.G. (Generalized Social Contribution), C.R.D.S. (Contribution for the Repayment of the Social Debt), and Social Security contributions.

---

#### 3.3.1. Beneficiaries

If the surviving spouse is not personally insured, they remain entitled to benefits:

- For one year following the death,

If the spouse receives the single parent allowance, they are automatically covered by Social Security.

After these periods, the spouse must apply for personal registration using a special form provided by the Primary Health Insurance Fund (CPAM) the deceased was affiliated with. [Template](./templates/healthInsurance/demandeDImmatriculationPersonnelleMatriculeSécuritéSociale.md)

If the surviving spouse is over 45 years old and has had three children, they may receive lifetime health coverage under certain conditions.

Receiving a survivor’s pension (pension de réversion) also grants entitlement to health insurance under the Social Security system.

The following pieces would be needed:

  - The type and amount of these benefits,
  - The income ceiling not to be exceeded in order to qualify.

## 4. Insurances

The main insurances in case of death are:

- Whole life insurance
- Term life insurance

---

### 4.1. Whole Life Insurance

---

The capital is paid out regardless of the cause of death. This type of policy is similar to a financial capitalization operation. It allows parents to ensure a means of subsistence for their children after their death. \
In life insurance contracts, insurance companies pay the capital or annuity directly to the beneficiary.

---

### 4.2. Term Life Insurance

---

It guarantees the payment of a lump sum or annuity in the event of death during the term of the contract. This could be an education annuity to fund a child’s studies in the event of the premature death of a parent, or insurance taken out to repay a loan. Term life insurance is subscribed on a “non-refundable” basis — regardless of when premium payments stop, the amounts already paid remain with the insurance company.

- Notify the insurance company as soon as possible of the death (check any documents left by the deceased). Send a registered letter along with:
  - the death certificate
  - a photocopy of the family record book so that the company can process the payment of the death benefit. [Template](./templates/insurances/versementDuCapitalDécèsPolice.md)
- Transfer the policy into the name of the surviving beneficiary or into the name of the estate, depending on the situation. Specify that the survivor is released from any future premium payments, in the case of life insurance. [Template](./templates/insurances/transfertNominatifDeLaPoliceDAssurance.md)
- Cancel the contracts (if the deceased was widowed or single). [Template](./templates/insurances/résiliationDeContratDAssurance.md)

Those letters should contain the following documents:

- "Un acte de décès"
- "Un original des conditions particulières"
- "Un certificat médical"
- "Une photocopie du livret de famille du bénéficiaire"
- "Un relevé d'identité bancaire, postal ou Caisse d'Épargne du bénéficiaire"

If the death results from an accident caused by a third party (such as a road accident), the surviving spouse must immediately notify their car insurance provider. \
A provisional compensation may be granted amicably if the third party’s liability is clearly established.

Assistance organizations may cover the repatriation costs from the place of death to the home or burial location.
