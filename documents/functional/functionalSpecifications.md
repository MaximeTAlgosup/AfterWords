## Introduction 

### Purpose  
<!-- - Briefly describe the purpose of the document and the system/product it defines.   -->

### Scope  
<!-- - Define the boundaries of the system, including what it will and will not cover.   -->

### Audience  
<!-- - Specify who the intended readers are (developers, testers, stakeholders, etc.).   -->

### Definitions And Acronyms  
<!-- - List key terms and abbreviations with their explanations.   -->

## System Overview

### Background
<!-- - Provide context for the system and why it is being developed.   -->

### System Architecture
<!-- - High-level description of how the system is structured.  
- Include diagrams if necessary.   -->

### Assumptions And Dependencies
