# AfterWords <!-- omit in toc -->

## Description <!-- omit in toc -->

### Overview

---

AfterWords would be a tool allowing people to get rid of an interminable administration path.

To do so, AfterWords would gather all the possible instances in which a deceased should be reported. \
The bereaved should only inform the tool which instances they'd like to send a mail informing the death. \
Once this is done, the bereaved would give the tool all the papers and documents needed for the different instances. \
After getting all the documents (in PDF format for now), the tool will link the given documents to the instances that need them. E-mails would be written to them following a template (with documents linked), and the sending would be done in one click, saving a lot of time for the bereaved.

---

### Technical Challenges

This Moonshot would encounter many technical challenges, some harder than others:

- **Matching APIs' constraints**: AfterWords should understand and find where to send the e-mail and to whom. Consequently, it should adapt to every API for every instance.
- **Password Leak**: AfterWords should have a way to find the deceased's password. If it doesn't, it couldn't send a proper e-mail informing the deceased's death.
- **Tool Support**: AfterWords should be accessible to everyone, including the diseased and elders. Consequently, the support should be easy to handle, and either a site (everyone can access it) or an application on Android and iOS (responsive).
- **DataBase**: AfterWords should have a database where all the information for each API and templates for mail are stored. (Examples non-exhaustive)

## Installation

<!-- TODO -->

For now, AfterWords cannot be installed because there is no code yet.

---

## Usage

1. Connect to AfterWords on your device.
2. Check the different instances and companies you want/ have to inform of your loved one.
3. Link all necessary/asked documents to AfterWords.
4. Complete the letters missing sections (security number, etc.).
5. Click on the Send button.

Well done, AfterWords can now send the letter to all the instances you checked with their necessary documents. The administration part is done.

## Contains

This repository will contain all the necessary documents for AfterWords alongside the code source of the application.

The code source can be found inside the [src folder](./src/) whereas the document would be stored within the [documents folder](./documents/).

The main documents inside this folder would be:

[**Functional Specifications**](./documents/functional/functionalSpecifications.md): Will explain what composed the project and visuals.
