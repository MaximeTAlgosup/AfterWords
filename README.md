# AfterWords

## Overview

AfterWords would be a tool allowing people to get rid of an interminable administration path.

To do so, AfterWords would gather all the possible instances in which a deceased should be reported. \
The bereaved should only inform the tool which instances they'd like to send a mail informing the death. \
Once this is done, the bereaved would give the tool all the papers and documents needed for the different instances. \
After getting all the documents (in PDF format for now), the tool will link the given documents to the instances that need them. E-mails would be written to them following a template (with documents linked), and the sending would be done in one click, saving a lot of time for the bereaved.

## Technical Challenges

This Moonshot would encounter many technical challenges, some harder than others:

- **Matching APIs' constraints**: AfterWords should understand and find where to send the e-mail and to whom. Consequently, it should adapt to every API for every instance.
- **Password Leak**: AfterWords should have a way to find the deceased's password. If it doesn't, it couldn't send a proper e-mail informing the deceased's death.
- **Tool Support**: AfterWords should be accessible to everyone, including the diseased and elders. Consequently, the support should be easy to handle, and either a site (everyone can access it) or an application on Android and iOS (responsive).
- **DataBase**: AfterWords should have a database where all the information for each API and templates for mail are stored. (Examples non-exhaustive)
